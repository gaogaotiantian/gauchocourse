PRE-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES MAJOR, 2016-2017 

Students are not admitted directly to the following majors: 
Biological Sciences, B.A. or B.S. Microbiology, B.S. Ecology and Evolution, B.S. 
Biochemistry-Molecular Biology, B.S. Pharmacology, B.S. Physiology, B.S. 
Cell and Developmental Biology, B.S. Aquatic Biology, B.S. Zoology, B.S. 

Instead, they are first admitted to the Pre-Biology major, and they may advance to full major standing in one of 
these majors only after fulfilling the pre-major courses and grade requirements listed below. Students will not be 
admitted to the pre-biology major after their seventh quarter (or equivalent), and students will only be admitted to 
the pre-major in their seventh quarter if they have completed introductory biology and most of the required pre-
biology major courses. 

Note: Completion of the pre-major does not fully satisfy the Preparation for the Major requirements for any of the 
majors. Students should review the full requirement sheet for the major they intend to declare and plan their 
schedules accordingly. Also note, acceptance into the pre-major does not guarantee admission to full major status. 

Students may petition for advancement to full major status in any one of the majors as soon as they have completed 
the required minimum of twelve courses with a 2.0 higher UC GPA in Area B, in Area C, and in Areas A and D 
combined. At the time of the petition, they must also have a 2.0 or higher grade-point average in all courses 
attempted toward the major (preparation and upper-division).  

Note:  Many upper-division EEMB and all MCDB courses require a C or higher in each of their prerequisite 
courses.  See General Catalog for details. 
 UNITS YET TO COMPLETE 
A. General Chemistry:  Chemistry 1A or 2A, 1B or 2B, 1C or 2C 

(The entire three-quarter series and laboratories are required for all EEMB 
and MCDB majors.) .................................................................................................................................. 9  

B. MCDB 1A, MCDB 1B, EEMB 2, EEMB 3 ............................................................................................ 13  
C. MCDB 1AL, either MCDB 1BL or EEMB 2L, EEMB 3L ....................................................................... 3  
D. Two courses from the following: ............................................................................................................ 6-9  
 Organic Chemistry lecture:  Chemistry 109A-B-C or Chemistry 109AH-BH-CH 

(Not required for Ecology and Evolution or Zoology.  Other majors add laboratory requirements  
to lecture.  Physiology and the MCDB majors require the entire 109 A-B-C or honors sequence.  Aquatic 
Biology, Biological Science B.A. and B.S. majors require 109A-B or 109AH-BH.) 

 Calculus:  Mathematics 3A or 34A, 3B or 34B 
(Biochemistry-Molecular Biology requires Math 3A-B and beyond.  The other majors give a choice of 3A-B or 
34A-B.) 

 Statistics or Advanced Calculus:  PSTAT 5LS or 5A or Math 4A (PSTAT 5LS or 5A strongly recommended for 
EEMB majors.  Biochemistry-Molecular Biology requires Math 4A and Math 6A.) 

 Physics:  6A-B-C 
(Biological Sciences B.A. does not require 6C.  Laboratories are required for all majors.) 

MAJOR REGULATIONS 
PREREQUSITES ...................................................... Check the General Catalog for the prerequisites to all listed courses. 
P/NP GRADING OPTION ....................................... Not allowed for any pre-major courses.  All must be completed on a letter grade basis. 
SUBSTITUTIONS ..................................................... In the major requirements permissible only by petition to the department chair and dean. 
RESIDENCE REQUIREMENTS ........................... At least 20 UD units in major while in residence at UCSB. 
G.P.A. REQUIREMENTS ....................................... At least 2.0 overall UC average in all upper-division major courses and all courses (Prep and UD) for 

the major, including courses in excess of minimum requirements. 
DOUBLE MAJORS .................................................. With the approval of each department chairperson, up to a total of 8 units may be applied 

simultaneously to both UD majors.
