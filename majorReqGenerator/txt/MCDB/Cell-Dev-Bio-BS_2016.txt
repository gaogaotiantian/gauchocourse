CELL AND DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY MAJOR, B.S – 2016-2017 

To be admitted to full major status, students must fulfill the pre-biology course and grade-point average requirements as 
described in the General Catalog and Pre-Biological Sciences Major Sheet. At the minimum, they must complete twelve 
designated courses from the Preparation for the Major with a 2.0 or higher UC grade-point average. Grades earned must 
meet grade prerequisites for the full major.  

Note: Hyphens indicate that an entire sequence must be completed as shown to fulfill an area requirement.
