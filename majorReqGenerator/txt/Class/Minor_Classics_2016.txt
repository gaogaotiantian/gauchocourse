The following conditions must also be met for official recognition of the minor: 

 The sponsoring department reports completion of the minor prior to the posting of the degree. 
 At least 18 upper-division quarter units are completed for the minor.  (Waivers cannot reduce the 

requirement below this number.) 
 At least 12 of the upper-division units for the minor are completed while in residence at UCSB.

minimum requirements, is 2.0 or higher. 
 No more than 5 upper-division units overlap between this minor and the upper-division portion of the

formally recognized; if overlap with other minor(s) is greater, only the first minor reported will be 
recognized.
