Requirements for the minor in

All courses to be applied to the minor must be completed on a letter grade basis.  This includes both 
courses offered in History and those offered by other departments and applied to the minor. 

PREPARATION UNITS 

12 lower-division units in History .................................................................................... 12  

UPPER-DIVISION 

20 upper division units in History ..................................................................................... 20  

The History Department strongly recommends that one of the upper-division courses be an undergraduate 
research seminar (any UD History course with the letter R after its course number).  

Substitutions and waivers are subject to approval by the chair of the department. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
            

 

Students must consult the General Catalog for prerequisites to required courses. 
 
The following conditions must also be met for official recognition of the minor: 
 
 The sponsoring department reports completion of the minor prior to the posting of the degree. 
 At least 18 upper-division quarter units are completed for the minor. (Waivers cannot reduce the 

requirement below this number.) 
 At least 12 of the upper-division units for the minor are completed while in residence at UCSB. 
 The UC grade-point average in ALL applicable upper-division courses, including those in excess of 

minimum requirements, is 2.0 or higher. 
 No more than 5 upper-division units overlap between this minor and the upper-division portion of the 

major(s) or other minor(s). If overlap is greater with the major(s), completion of the minor will not be 
formally recognized; if overlap with other minor(s) is greater, only the first minor reported will be 
recognized.
