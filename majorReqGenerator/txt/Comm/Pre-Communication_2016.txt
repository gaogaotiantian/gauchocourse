PRE-COMMUNICATION MAJOR â€“ 2016-2017 

Students will be admitted to full Communication major status only after they complete 
Communication 1, 87, 88, and 89 with no grade below C- and with a UC grade-point average in 
these four courses of at least 3.00.  If a student has taken an introductory statistics course at 
UCSB other than Communication 87 (PSTAT 5A, 5LS, or Psychology 5), the grade received in 
that course will automatically count towards the Communication pre-major GPA.  
Communication 87 may not be taken after other lower-division statistics courses. 

PRE-MAJOR REQUIREMENTS UNITS YET TO COMPLETE 

Communication 1 .................................................................................................................. 5  

Communication 87 ................................................................................................................ 5  

Communication 88 ................................................................................................................ 5  

Communication 89 ................................................................................................................ 5  

Students intending to become a Communication major are strongly encouraged to declare  
Pre-Communication as their major.  Upon completion of the pre-major course requirements  
with a 3.00 GPA, students may petition to full major status, generally prior to the accumulation 
of 100 units, but not after the completion of 144 units.   

Admission to the pre-major does not guarantee admission to the Communication major, 
regardless of the number and outcome of upper division Communication units taken.
