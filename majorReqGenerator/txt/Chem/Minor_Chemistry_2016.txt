Requirements for the minor in 
CHEMISTRY, 2016-2017 

All courses to be applied to the minor must be completed on a letter-grade basis. This includes both 
courses offered in Chemistry and those offered by other departments and applied to the minor. 

PREPARATION 

No specific courses are required in preparation for the minor in Chemistry, but students should note 
that most upper-division chemistry courses include Chemistry 1A-B-C with labs as prerequisite, and  
some may require Mathematics through 6A as prerequisite. 

UPPER-DIVISION UNITS 

23 UD units are required, distributed as follows: 

One course from Chemistry 113A-B-C ........................................................................... 4  

Chemistry 150 .................................................................................................................. 3  

Additional upper-division units in Chemistry, with no more than one course from 
Chemistry 123 and 149 .................................................................................................. 16  
 
The following courses will not apply toward the minor: 
Chemistry 101, 102, 183, 184, 192, 193, 196, and 199 

Substitutions and waivers are subject to approval by the chair of the department. 

Students must consult the General Catalog for prerequisites to required courses. 

The following conditions must also be met for official recognition of the minor: 

 The sponsoring department reports completion of the minor prior to the posting of the degree. 
 At least 18 upper-division quarter units are completed for the minor.  (Waivers cannot reduce the 

requirement below this number.) 
 At least 12 of the upper-division units for the minor are completed while in residence at UCSB. 
 The UC grade-point average in ALL applicable upper-division courses, including those in excess of 

minimum requirements, is 2.0 or higher. 
 No more than 5 upper-division units overlap between this minor and the upper-division portion of the 

major(s) or other minor(s).  If overlap is greater with the major(s), completion of the minor will not be 
formally recognized; if overlap with other minor(s) is greater, only the first minor reported will be 
recognized.
