PRE-CHEMISTRY MAJOR, 2016-2017 
 
Students are not admitted directly to the following majors: Biochemistry, B.S., Chemistry, B.S., Chemistry, B.A. Instead, 
they are first admitted to the Pre-Chemistry major, and they may advance to full major standing in one of these majors 
only after fulfilling the pre-major courses and grade requirements listed below. 
 
A UC GPA of 2.00 or above in each of the six sequences of courses, considered separately, is required for advancement to 
full-major status. Acceptance into the pre-major does not guarantee admission to full major status. Upon satisfactory 
completion of the pre-major courses, students must complete a change of major petition, available in the Department of 
Chemistry and Biochemistry Student Affairs Office.  
 
Note: Completion of the pre-major does not fully satisfy the Preparation for the Major requirements for the Biochemistry 
B.S., Chemistry B.S. or the Chemistry B.A. Students should review the full requirement sheet for the major they intend to 
declare and plan their schedules accordingly. At the time of the petition, they must also have a 2.0 or higher grade-point 
average in all courses attempted toward the major (preparation and upper-division).
